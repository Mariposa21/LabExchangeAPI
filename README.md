# LabExchangeAPI

*Hello there! :wave:

*This is an in-progress API I am currently working on to showcase an API for Lab Test results. :hospital: :incoming_envelope:

*It primarily uses T-SQL (SQL Server database) and C# (.NET 6.0 platform, EF Core 7). I plan on lifting the versions up to .NET 8.0/EF Core 8 when appropriate. 

*The latest code version is a fully-functional Proof-of-concept. The code builds and can be run locally. All controller endpoints can be called locally via Postman for testing. 

*This ReadMe file will be polished as this codebase is further developed, including a local demonstration of the API's behavior.
